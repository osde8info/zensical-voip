if you have a giffgaff mobile be sure to install the giffgaff app and giffgaff wifi extra profile

gg wifi extra is amazing "its not just wifi its gg wifi"

its what wifi should have always been ie its a auto config and auto connect wifi that connects in mcdonalds AND the london underground with no user intervention
