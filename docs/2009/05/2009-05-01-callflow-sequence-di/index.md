[CallFlow Sequence Diagram Generator](http://callflow.sourceforge.net/ "callflow") is a collection of awk and shell scripts that will take a capture file that can be read by ethereal and produce a callflow sequence diagram.  The scripts have been primarily tested with SIP call flows, but should work for other network traffic as well.

Examples
