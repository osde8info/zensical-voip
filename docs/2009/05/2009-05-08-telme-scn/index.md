[Telme](http://www.telme.sg/en/project/ "telme") is a _Social Communication Network that is born as a combination of social WiFi, cutting-edge VoIP and richer media communication._

_The difference between Telme and any traditional communication network is that it is powered by users, being simultaneously local and global._

_Telme Network is built to create a real communication environment with an all-in-one device — AirGate, and TelmeWorlds portal._
