The [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r2/index.html "android sdk") includes a mobile device emulator -- a virtual mobile device that runs on your computer. The emulator lets you prototype, develop, and test [Android](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfqodzzaV88) applications without using a physical device.

The [Android emulator](http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html "android emulator") mimics all of the typical hardware and software features of a typical mobile device, except that it can not receive or place actual phone calls. It provides a variety of navigation and control keys, which you can "press" using your mouse or keyboard to generate events for your application. It also provides a screen in which your application is displayed, together with any other Android applications running.
