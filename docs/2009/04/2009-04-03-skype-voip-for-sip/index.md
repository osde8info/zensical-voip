[Skype For SIP](http://networks.silicon.com/telecoms/0,39024659,39410917,00.htm "skype") allows companies to use the Skype service with their IP-enabled PBXs, which use an open standard called SIP or Session Initiation Protocol. Companies using the service can make phone calls from their office phones to any regular phone or mobile phone at the same cheap rates that Skype's consumer customers can.
