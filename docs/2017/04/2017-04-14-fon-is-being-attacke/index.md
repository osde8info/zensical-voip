FON is being attacked on all three sides - by @BT, @VirginMedia as well as itself #broadband #wifi #fail

- BT announced it will drop the word FON from all its hotspots by the end of the year
- VirginMedia have announced everyones router will be PUBLICALLY enabled unless you OPT OUT by the end of this year
- FON have CANCELLED all end user contracts and sales and support and now only deal with telcos

FON is refusing to refund ANY of its old customers sayings its T&Cs allow them to do this.

If you DONT want to share your your VirginMedia router you need to

- TURN IT OFF immediately
- call the VirgiaMedia OPTOUT team
- WAIT 7 days
- TURN IT ON

a workaround may be to switch your router into modem mode and BUY your own wifi router but it all depends on what the proprietary secret VIrginMedia router firmware actually does
