the goog voice voip telephone service has been updated and

- https://www.google.com/voice/b/0#history

has moved to

- https://voice.google.com/calls

If you havent used your account for over 5 years under US law goog will have to give your credit to the US government (the State of Delaware if you are outside the US) so check your account today !

_Companies in the US are obliged to give assets that they believe are abandoned to US state governments. The appropriate state government is the state where you've told us you reside. If you reside outside the US, then the state of Delaware, our state of incorporation, is the appropriate state government._

However the new google voice client doesnt currently work with mozilla firefox or ms edge browsers
