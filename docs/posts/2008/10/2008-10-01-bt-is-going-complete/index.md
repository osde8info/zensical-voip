BT, in consultation with the UK telecommunications industry, and with input from Ofcom, is upgrading its phone, broadband and ISDN lines to a next-generation network. This evolution in communications will not only provide the services all of us enjoy today, but will also enable more people to access exciting new services in the future.

_There will be some [disruption](http://www.switchedonuk.org/home/how/serviceInterruptions/) to your phone, broadband and ISDN services in the months and weeks leading up to the work and on the nights when your services get switched-on. This will typically mean that you will be unable to make outbound calls for up to three minutes or receive incoming calls for up to 30 minutes when phone services are switched-on. If you have a broadband service, this will be interrupted for up to 10 minutes when broadband services are switched-on._
