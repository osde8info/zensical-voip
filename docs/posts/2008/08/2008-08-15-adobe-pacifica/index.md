Here are some quick facts about [Adobe Pacifica](http://pac.ifica.net/ "pacifica"):

- _Pacifica is built on top of the open standard [SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) protocol._
- _The first mission is to maintain the highest quality voice experience possible, pushing the boundaries of the Flash Platform._
- _Right now, Pacifica enables point-to-point ([P2P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)) transmission of the media channel once the connection is established via our servers._
- _They are dedicated to a complete P2P solution going forward, to eliminate the complex server back end and configuration needed with most VoIP technologies._
