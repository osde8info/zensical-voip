[i-p-tel](http://www.i-p-tel.com/ "i p tel") have just launched a [G.722 HD VOIP beta](http://www2.pbxes.com/community.php?display=forum&news=1 "pbxes") trial however -

_all ATAs are automatically excluded, as they don't support anything better than G.711, since the telephone sets connected to their FXS ports don't support the additional frequencies required._
