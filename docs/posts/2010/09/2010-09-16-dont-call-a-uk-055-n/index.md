according to [aaisp](http://aaisp.net.uk/kb-telecoms-055.html) owners of [UK 055 numbers](http://aaisp.net.uk/kb-telecoms-055.html "aaisp") can

_set whatever rate they like, so different numbers could have wildly different prices for similar numbers !_

so make sure you use a [UK 03 number](http://aaisp.net.uk/kb-telecoms-03.html "aaisp") instead because **03 numbers are not premium rate or expensive to call.**

_In fact OFCOM have made it a rule that all telcos must charge no more than they would for normal 01 or 02 numbers and they must include 03 numbers in the same call packages as they do for 01 and 02 numbers._
