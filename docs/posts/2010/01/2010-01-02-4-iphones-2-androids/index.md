Since Orange, T-Mobile and Vodafone joined O2 in selling iphones in UK there are now four UK iphone networks to choose from and now 3 (three) have followed T-Mobile by launching a [hero htc android](http://www.three.co.uk/Pay_Monthly/Top_mobiles "three") phone ! However it comes at a price ! £35/m so if you just want Skype/VOIP you might prefer the 3 [Nokia E63](http://www.three.co.uk/Pay_Monthly/Top_mobiles "three") for just £10/m and yo can add data for an extra £5/m !
