We have just discovered a VOIP distro that you can rent for £15/m from [kimsufi & ovh](http://www.ovh.co.uk/items/distributions/elastix.xml "kimsufi & ovh") called [Elastix®](http://www.elastix.org/ "elastix") !

[ohloh stats](https://www.ohloh.net/p/elastix/analyses/latest "ohloh elastix") suggest that the Elastix interface is mainly written in PHP and Elastix® even sell a VOIP over USB [Elastibank™ Channel Bank](http://www.elastix.org/en/appliances.html "elastix") allow you to connect to any Elastix® Appliance model via USB 2.0 _eliminating the need for an intermediating PCI (the solution used by other channel banks)._

[Elastix® technology partners](http://www.elastix.org/en/technology-partners.html "elastix partners") include aastra, atcom, openvox, redfone, sangoma and yealink !

There are even some [Elastix videos on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/elastixPBX#g/c/18713D328583DB34 "elastix") !
