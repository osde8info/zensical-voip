FON and BT have partnered to create the [BT FON Community](http://www.btfon.com/) to cover the entire U.K. with hundreds of thousands of BT FON hotspots. FON, the world’s largest Wi-Fi Community, and BT is one of the leading broadband providers in the world, and the birth of our BT FON Community means something uniquely special for broadband users in the U.K. and all over the world.

FON has now been integrated in BT and now more than more than 3 million Total Broadband customers are invited to join the enormous global community of people sharing their WiFi. FON equity investors include Excite, Google & Skype amongst others !

VOIP over Wi-Fi has now arrived in the UK as a viable mobile phone alternative !
