[YATE](http://yate.null.ro/pmwiki/index.php "yate") is a next-generation telephony engine; while currently focused on [Voice over Internet Protocol](http://www.fcc.gov/voip/) (VoIP) and [PSTN](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/PSTN.html), its power lies in its ability to be easily extended. Voice, video, data and instant messaging can all be unified under Yate's flexible routing engine, maximizing communications efficiency and minimizing infrastructure costs for businesses.
