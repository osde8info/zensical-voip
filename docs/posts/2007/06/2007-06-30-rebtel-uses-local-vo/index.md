From what I can tell [REPTEL](https://www.rebtel.com/en/Utility-Pages/Join-flow/Join/ "reptel") uses local number gateways to create a two person conference call so that ANYONE on ANY phone system can talk to ANYONE else ANYWHERE else (internationally or mobilly) for the price of a local call (or in their included minutes) !
