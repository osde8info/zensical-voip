is virginmobile switching from @EE to @O2 or @vodafone ? confused ? you should be

apparently @virginmobile signed a deal with @vodafone for 2021 to 2026 but they have just announced they will merge with @o2 !

so potentially they will run two MVNOs with old customers moved to @vodafone and new customers setup on @o2
