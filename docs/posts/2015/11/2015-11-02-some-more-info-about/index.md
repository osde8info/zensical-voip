Here's some more info about the UKs first almost free 3G VOIP mobile network from freedompop

- http://www.freedompop.com/uk

IT REALLY IS VOIP based and ONLY works if you have 3G network data connectivity and ONLY works on modern android and iphone smartphones and ONLY gives you 200 min and 200M free each month.

However you can PAY for extras such as

- £2/m extra to make GSM calls
- £1/m extra for voicemail
- £1.50/m extra to roll over unused data to following month
- £1/m extra for SMS usagewarnings

or you can always buy the £9/m bundle (but it would no longer be FREE) which includes

- 1000 minutes
- 1000 texts
- 1GB data
- GSM calls

If you do sign up to avoid paying monthly fees you must immediately disable default extras by going to http://www.freedompop.com/acct\_plan.htm and chosing the BASIC plan.
