SIP Peering is the term given to agreement between VoIP Service Providers which enables the users of one service to call users of another. This is implemented by dialing a special prefix number and then the number of the receipitant (on the 'other' service). For example [Ekiga.net](https://www.ekiga.net/index.php?page=services "ekiga") users can use the [SipBroker's White page prefixes](http://www.sipbroker.com/sipbroker/action/providerWhitePages) to call anybody on other SIP networks.
