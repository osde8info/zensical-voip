[iNum](http://www.inum.net/what-is-inum/what-is-inum/ "inum") stands for international Number.

_It is a new kind of global phone number for a new kind of world -- a world with a new geography that's about local presence and global relationships, not about distance or national borders._

_iNum is making use of the +883 global country code newly created by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union)._
