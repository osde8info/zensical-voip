The [Krispy Kreme and The Cloud](http://www.thecloud.net/page/7104 "thecloud") announcement says:

_“Traditionally our customers have come to stores to relax and unwind with our doughnuts and hot drinks.  The new WiFi service and free filter coffee refills mean that they can now kick back for a little longer whether they are busy working on the move or just chilling out and making the most of being online.”_
