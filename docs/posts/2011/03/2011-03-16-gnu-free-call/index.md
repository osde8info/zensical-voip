[GNU Free Call](http://planet.gnu.org/gnutelephony/ "gnu") is a new project to develop and deploy secure self-organized communication services worldwide for private use and for public administration.

[GNU Free Call](http://www.gnutelephony.org/ "gnutelephony") uses the open standard SIP protocol and GNU SIP Witch to create secured peer-to-peer mesh calling networks.
