has anyone else noticed that goog android has major micro sd card and usb otg storage issues / problems ?

well i have a [Xiaomi Mi Redmi 5](https://amzn.to/2SUAiwH) and it certainly does ! the file manager doesnt even let you navigate to USB OTG

then you seem to have to go into every app and see if it has an option to use microsd instead of internal storage

well i am going to try a factory reset AFTER installing my SanDisk 128G microSD card to see if that improves things but the web gives you 20 different answers if this will help or not
