It turns out that [O2 are creating a free-of-charge UK wi-fi network](http://www.o2.co.uk/wifi "o2") similar to [FON](http://corp.fon.com/en "fon") and The Cloud

and [The Cloud themselves have just been bought by SKY](http://www.silicon.com/technology/networks/2011/01/28/the-cloud-becomes-sky-bskyb-buys-wi-fi-network-39746878/ "silicon") !
