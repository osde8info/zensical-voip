_VDSL offers speeds of up to 52 [Mbit/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbit/s "Mbit/s") [downstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downstream_\(networking\) "Downstream (networking)") and 16 Mbit/s [upstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_\(networking\) "Upstream (networking)"),[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSL#cite_note-3) over a single flat untwisted or [twisted pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair "Twisted pair") of copper wires using the frequency band from 25 [kHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHz "KHz") to 12 MHz.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSL#cite_note-4) These rates mean that VDSL is capable of supporting applications such as [high-definition television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television "High-definition television"), as well as telephone services ([voice over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP "Voice over IP")) and general [Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access "Internet access"), over a single connection. VDSL is deployed over existing wiring used for [analog telephone service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service "Plain old telephone service") and lower-speed DSL connections._

_This standard was approved by the [International Telecommunication Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union") (ITU) in November 2001._
