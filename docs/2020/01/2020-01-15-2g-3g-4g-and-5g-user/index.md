_Ericsson are predicting that 1.5 billion users - 40 per cent of the global population coverage - will have access to a 5G network by 2024._

_A 5G network supports ultra-high-speed data rates of up to 10 Gbps, low latency or delay and can cope with up to a million devices per square kilometer. With 5G, you can download a typical high-definition movie in under 40 seconds, as opposed to more than seven minutes with 4G._
