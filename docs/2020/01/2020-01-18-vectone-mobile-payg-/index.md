i seem to have come across a bizarre bug with vectone mobile payg sims and a Huawei HONOR  KIW-L21 phone

first it has 2 sim slots and if you read the small print slot 1 only runs 2G and slot 2 can run 2G/3G/4G

so what i think happened is i put my vectone sim in slot 1 first which seems to have disabled data on the HONOR phone (and make tethering invisible when it is inserted into an iphone) but everything works fine when i put it in a MI

workaround

- my primary giffgaff sim in my HONOR
- my backup giffgaff sim is in my IPHONE
- my vectone sim is in my MI
