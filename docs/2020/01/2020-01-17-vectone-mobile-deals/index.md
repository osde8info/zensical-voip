the latest [vectone](https://www.vectonemobile.co.uk/) mobile deal is 30G for £10 which is comparable to giffgaffs 40G for £20 however there are a couple of bugs

- NO DATA on a HONOR KIW-L21
- Vectone X app errors on a a HONOR KIW-L2 and an IPHONE

so will have to stick with giffgaff for the time being

FYI

- giffgaff MVNO runs on O2
- [vectone](https://www.vectonemobile.co.uk/) MVNO runs on EE
