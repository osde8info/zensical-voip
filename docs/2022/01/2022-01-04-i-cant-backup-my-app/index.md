i cant backup my @apple #iphone because of @apple @icloud #backup policies

when do apple think i would i want to do a backup ? wouldnt you think it would sensible to do a backup before a system update ! BUT NO apple backups may fail if you are not on the latest iOS release and give you a error msg saying

_"this iphone cannot be backed up because there is not enough icloud storage available"_

even if icloud itself says "7.5 MB of 5G used"

also check how many apps you have installed

apple backups will fail if you have > 5GB of apps since apple only allow you to backup 5GB for free (you have to pay an extra monthly charge to backup more)
