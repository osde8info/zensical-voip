apple do get #backwards compatibility

they have added 2FA to icloud for imacs, ipads, iphones & macbooks but you can still login with 2FA even on an ipad MB292 (ipad2 ?) that is running ios 5.1.1

even though iOS 5.1.1GUI doesnt have a 2FA popup you can login BY APPENDING YOUR 2FA CODE TO YOUR ICLOUD PASSWORD

ie instead of "password" you just type "password123456"

also "Find My iPad" has been renamed "Find My" and now works with apple mobiles, notebooks & tablets
