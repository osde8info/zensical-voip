There is a [Fedora VOIP SIG](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/VoIP "fedora") that aims to package as many Voice over IP applications as possible for Fedora. To that end, members will assist in packaging VoIP applications and make reviewing VoIP-related packages our priority.

Packages they are working on include asterix, openser and twinkle.
