wierd and wacky mobile tieups from @O2 and @THREE #mobile #mktg #tieup #mktgfail #mktgsuccess

_Just drop your cabin bags at the dedicated easyJet Plus Bag Drop, stroll through security stress-free, and even board the plane early. Plus your cabin bags will be one of the first onto the carousel when you arrive at the other side._

_You’ll get a special Three tote bag to take anything you need onto the plane, free of charge_

and finally threes go-binge deal seems a bit pointless to me if you are already on their unlimited data plan
